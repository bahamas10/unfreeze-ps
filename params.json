These \"problems\" include\r\nrunning low on RAM, running low on disk space, or using 100% CPU.\r\n\r\nAfter you alleviate the \"problems\" mentioned above, running this program will send\r\na `SIGCONT` signal to the photoshop process to tell it to continue operating.\r\n\r\n### Will this always work?\r\n\r\nNo.  If your photoshop is beach balling for another reason, this will not do anything.\r\n\r\n### Is this dangerous to do?\r\n\r\nNo.  `SIGCONT` is a harmless signal to send if the process is not paused; it'll be as-if\r\nnothing has happened.  Worst-case scenario: this program does nothing.\r\n\r\nReal Life Stories\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n- http://skyeillustration.com/post/66-photoshop-trick\r\n\r\nLegacy\r\n------\r\n\r\nThis program was originally written in [Node.js](http://nodejs.org), and bundled as an app with\r\n[node-webkit](https://github.com/rogerwang/node-webkit).\r\n\r\nThis is found in the `legacy` directory\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n-------\r\n\r\nMIT\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
